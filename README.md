## Modifying the site

The website is defined as a set of markdown files which are loaded and parsed by docsify.

To test locally, you need to serve the website.
On Linux or MacOS, try

```
cd public
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

or possibly on Windows

```
cd public
python -m http.server
```

Navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser of choice.
